 # Ella's event log
 ## Sunday - 31 May (Discord call)
 After a little struggle with finding a time that works for everyone, we finally had a call to discuss and plan. By then, Michael had already finished a working form of the Core, while me (Manuela) and Maurice hadn't been able to install the entire project yet, due to working on windows. We decided on a rough timeline (see above/history of commits) as well as vague roles, but emphasized that everyone would try to help with the code. 
 
 ## Monday -- 01 June (Meeting with Arthur)
 Due to our issues with Windows, Maurice and me met up with Arthur, so that he could try and help us fix that. Unfortunately, that didn't work out because Windows is weird, but we did clarify a few questions, including tips as to how to deal with coding in a group (one person "writes the code", here Michael, two people test + document it, one person tells everyone what to do and makes sure they do it), and learnt that Michael's core code, despite concerns that "the robot doesn't "enter" the goal", it was fine and we had finished the first part! We also learnt that "wiki discussion" just meant that the markers would look at our GitHub.
 
 For now, the next tasks are listed above, but predominantly summarise to "test and find any bugs in Core, start Completion and get Windows working". Our next meeting is on Wednesday, 5pm, where we will hopefully all be able to discuss the start of Challenge and have Core submittable! :)
