**Install Instructions (for Linux):**
1. **Project Libraries:**
 * -First you need to download and install the SFML project libraries at https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/.
 * -Make sure that you download the correct version (for Linux) https://www.sfml-dev.org/files/SFML-2.5.1-linux-gcc-64-bit.tar.gz  
 * -After you have installed the libraries for the project you then have to unzip the file to the folder of your choice.
2. **Project Installation:**
 * -Download the repository with our code at https://github.com/ManuelaSpies/ENGR101-Project-3
 * -Inside the file there are two folders (server and robot).
 * -Open the file makefile (inside the server folder) using Geany or if you have no C compiler then you can use a text  editor.
 * -In the top line in makefile you must replace the address with the address to the folder where your SFML folder is.
 * -Just double check to see if all the lines starting with g++ have a tab in front of them.
 * -Press the "make" button in the geany menu in server.cpp to make (compile and build) the server (maze).
 * -Press "Execute" or F5 to run the server (maze).
3. **Project Code:**
 * -Open the file makefile (inside the robot folder) using Geany.
 * -In the top line in makefile you must replace the address with the address to the folder where your SFML folder is.
 * -In robot.cpp you must press the "make" button to compile and build the code for the robot.
 * -To run the code press "execute" or F5 and then the robot will start moving and finding it's way through the maze.
 
 **C Compiler:**
 
 To use SFML, a C compiler is required. Your Linux machine is likely to already have gcc and g++ installed - check this with 
 ```g++ --version```.
 If that command fails, run
 ```sudo apt install build-essential```
 to install gcc and g++.
